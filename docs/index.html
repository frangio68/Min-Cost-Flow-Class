<h2><a class="anchor" id="intro"></a>
Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the Doxygen documentation for the "pure LGPL part" of MCFClass project, a set of C++ solvers for (Linear or Convex Quadratic Separable) Min Cost Flow Problem solvers under the same interface seriving from the base class MCFClass.</p>
<p>The aim of MCFClass is to provide an abstraction layer between practitioners who need to solve MCF problems within complex applications and developers of MCF software. The idea is to provide an interface which caters for all the needs that a practitioner can have, thereby allowing him/her to use whichever algorithm - among those that have an implementation conforming to this interface - without bothering with the details of the implementation, and to easily switch between different algorithms.</p>
<p>MCFClass defines and "exports" the types of "flows" (MCFClass::FNumber), "costs" (MCFClass::CNumber) and so on, together with a set of comparison operators (ETZ, GTZ, ...) which automatically detect whether or not the underlying types are integers or floats, inserting appropriate "epsilons" in the latter case and avoiding them (for speed) in the former; these things are sorted out at compile time without user intervention.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="license"></a>
License</h2>
<p>This code is provided free of charge under the "GNU Lesser General Public 
License". There are actually two more complete solvers available under the MCFClass interface, namely CS2 and MCFZIB. These are, however, distributed under a more restrictive academic license, which has to be explicitly accepted before getting hold of the code. Request forms are available in the req folder</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="contents"></a>
Contents</h2>
<p>This release comprises:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">docs/: this documentation, also available at</p>
<p class="startli"><a href="https://frangio68.github.io/Min-Cost-Flow-Class/">https://frangio68.github.io/Min-Cost-Flow-Class/</a></p>
</li>
<li>doxygen/: doxygen files to produce the documentation</li>
<li>License.md: the text of the "GNU Lesser General Public
   License", Version 3.0, under which most of this code is distributed (but not all of it, see RelaxIV below)</li>
<li>MCFClass/: definition of the base class</li>
<li>MCFClone/: implements a "fake" MCF solver that takes two "real" ones and does everything on both; useful for testing the solvers (either for correctness or for efficiency) when used within "complex" approaches</li>
<li>MCFCplex/: implements a MCF solver conforming to the MCFClass interface based on calls to the commercial (but free for academic purposes) IBM/ILOG Cplex solver</li>
<li>MCFSimplex/: implements a MCF solver conforming to the MCFClass interface based on the primal and dual revised network simplex algorithm</li>
<li>OPTUtils/: contains the <code><a class="el" href="OPTUtils_8h.html" title="Small classes are provided for:">OPTUtils.h</a></code> file with a few minor utility functions</li>
<li>ReadMe.md: this file</li>
<li>RelaxIV/: implements a MCF solver conforming to the MCFClass interface based on the RELAXIV code by D. Bertsekas and P. Tseng, as described in Bertsekas, Dimitri P., and Paul Tseng. "RELAX-IV: A faster version of the RELAX code for solving minimum
       cost flow problems." (1994), Report LIDS-P-2276, MIT. be aware that RelaxIV is distributed under a less permissive academic license than the rest of the code (see RelaxIV/academicl.txt for details), which only applies to researchers of noncommercial and academic institutions, e.g., universities; if the license does not apply to you, you must not download the source or delete it immediately</li>
<li>req/: folder containing two request forms for two other solvers derived from the MCFClass interface that cannot be directly distributed in the repo due to licensing restrictions, see below</li>
<li>SPTree/: implements a MCF solver partly conforming to the MCFClass interface, in the sense that is only able to solve MCF instances that are in fact Shortest Path Tree ones (that is, only one source node and no arc capacities), but then does so using SPT algorithms (both label-setting and label-correcting variants can be used) that are much faster than complete MCF ones</li>
<li>pyMCFSimplex-0.9/: a Python-Wrapper for the MCFSimplex solver by Johannes from the G#.Blog, check the README.txt for details</li>
<li>test/: contains two example Main files to use the library. One solves a given MCF instance with any one MCF solver, which can be chosen by just changing two lines of code. The other compares the results of two solvers in order to verify that they agree. See the comments in both files for more details</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two more complete solvers available under the MCFClass interface, namely CS2 and MCFZIB. These are, however, distributed under a more restrictive academic license, which has to be explicitly accepted before getting hold of the code. Request forms are available in the req folder.</p>
<p>A further solver, MCFIntPnt (based on Interior-Point algorithms) has been developed, but it has not yet reached a sufficient maturuty to be distributed; its principles are discussed at</p>
