#   makefile of libMCFCl as a pre-built library                              #
#                                                                            #
#   This makefile is thought to be included by the makefile of some code     #
#   using the libMCFCl library. However, this makefile treats libMCFCl as    #
#   a pre-built library, in the sense that it ensures that it is built (by   #
#   a separate make process) and then returns as $(libMCFClOBJ) the          #
#   complete libMCFCl library together with macros $(libMCFClINC) and        #
#   $(libMCFClLIB) for includes and external libreries. It is therefore a    #
#   way to keep the make process of libMCFCl separate from the make process  #
#   of the code using it, as opposed to directly including makefile-c that   #
#   "entirely merges the two make processes°. However, note that if $(CC)    #
#   and $(SW) are defined by the including makefile, they will be            #
#   "forwarded" to the makefile of libMCFCl so as to ensure that the         #
#   compiler/options are consistent between the two make processes.          #
#                                                                            #
#   Input:  $(libMCFClDIR) = the directory where the libMCFCl source is      #
#                                                                            #
#           optional: $(CC) = the C++ compiler command                       #
#                                                                            #
#           optional: $(SW) = the compiler options (optimization, debug,     #
#                     required C++ standard, ...)                            #
#                                                                            #
#   Output: there is no $(libMCFClH) output, since the calling makefile has  #
#           no need to check for changes in the .h and rebuild the .a: this  #
#           is all done here inside. However, the following macros are       #
#           provided because the code using libMCFCl need to know where to   #
#           find the .h files to include, which external libreries and       #
#            -L<libdirs> need be used in the linking phase, and of course    #
#           libMCFCl.a need be linked against.                               #
#           $(libMCFClINC) = the -I$(include directories) for libMCFCl       #
#           $(libMCFClLIB) = external libreries + -L<libdirs> for libMCFCl   #
#           $(libMCFClOBJ) = the libMCFCl.a library itself                   #
#                                                                            #
#   Internally, the makefile calls makefile-c, strips away the *H macro and  #  
#   redefines the *OBJ one. It then uses the standard front-end makefile-lib #
#   to have the library built, "forwarding" it $(CC) and $(SW) if they have  #
#   been provided by the including makefile.                                 #
#                                                                            #
