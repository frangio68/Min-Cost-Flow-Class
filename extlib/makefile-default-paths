#   Input: in principle none, as the external libraries usually have some    #
#          absolute path; however, $(libMCFClDIR) = the directory where the  #
#          MCFClass source is should always be available (this is assumed    #
#          to be included by $(libMCFClDIR)/lib/makefile-c where the value   #
#          must be defined) in case some of the external libraries happen to #
#          rather be located at a relative path from there.                  #
#                                                                            #
#   Output: whatever macro is required by the external libraries makefiles,  #
#           to be found in $(libMCFClDIR)/extlib.                            #
#                                                                            #
#   The usefulness of packing all these definitions here lies in the fact    #
#   that one can then copy this file into                                    #
#                                                                            #
#        $(libMCFClDIR)/extlib/makefile-paths                                #
#                                                                            #
#   and change in there any path that is not in the default location that    #
#   this file specifies. Hopefully it should be enough to edit this one file #
#   to obtain a working installation, both for makefile (save minor issues   #
#   like compiler options) and Cmake, for the whole of the MCFClass project. #
#   The point is that makefile-paths file is .gitignore-d. Hence, it should  #
#   not be necessary to re-change the makefiles (or stash/restore the        #
#   changes) each time the project is pulled, or manually ignore the changes #
#   when it is pushed, which is very convenient for anyone who actually      #
#   develops MCFClass components (anyone there?)                             #
#                                                                            #
