#   Input: in principle none, as the external libraries usually have some    #
#          absolute path; however, $(libMCFClDIR) = the directory where the  #
#          MCFClass source is should always be available (this is assumed    #
#          to be included by $(libMCFClDIR)/lib/makefile-c where the value   #
#          must be defined) in case some of the external libraries happen to #
#          rather be located at a relative path from there.                  #
#                                                                            #
#   Output: whatever macro is required by the external libraries makefiles,  #
#           to be found in $(libMCFClDIR)/extlib, that is not already        #
#           properly defined by $(libMCFClDIR)/extlib/makefile-default-paths #
#           since the corresponding library does not sit at its default      #
#           location.                                                        #
#                                                                            #
#   The usefulness of packing all these definitions here lies in the fact    #
#   that this file is explcitly .gitignore-d. Hopefully it should be enough  #
#   to edit this one file to obtain a working makefile installation for the  #
#   whole of the MCFClass project. Then, it will not be necessary to         #
#   re-change the makefiles (or stash/restore the changes) each time parts   #
#   of the project are pulled, or manually ignore the changes when they are  #
#   pushed.                                                                  #
